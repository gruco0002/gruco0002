## Hello

Hi, my name is Corbinian and I am working as a software developer.
In 2023 I completed my master's degree in computer science at the University of Freiburg.
In my spare time, I like to code on small and large projects.
I am most interested in:
* Simulation (Fluid Solvers, SPH)
* Computer Graphics
* Back- and Frontend development

Most of the time I use the following languages for my projects:
* C++
* Delphi / Object Pascal
* Dart (and the Flutter framework)
